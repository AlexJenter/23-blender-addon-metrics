First Blender Addon, because i needed this for work.
It allows me to do two things.

1. Setup my scene to use millimeters
1. Generate a report with metrics relevant to the production of objects. These help us and our clients get a feel for the the scope and scale of the productions.

I know there are more simple ways to achieve this like the 3D-Print Toolbox or just by means  of a small script.
This was just a simple way to distribute to collegues and unify the way these metrics are represented in offers and internal documents.
